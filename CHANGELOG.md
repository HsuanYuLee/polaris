- **PM section: Max plan requirement** — cost callout added at top of PM workflow
- **PM section: troubleshooting tip** — "check MCP connections" one-liner added

- **13 new backlog items** from v1.9.0 audit findings (skill genericization, hook matcher, PM setup, etc.)

## [1.9.0] - 2026-03-30

- **Chinese Quick Start guide** — full `docs/quick-start-zh.md` covering prerequisites, setup steps, skill examples, and PM workflow in 中文; linked from README Quick Start section
- **PM & Scrum workflow narrative** — new README section mapping the complete sprint lifecycle to Polaris commands: sprint planning → standup → refinement → breakdown → worklog report, with bilingual trigger phrases and expected outputs

## [1.8.0] - 2026-03-30

- **Memory isolation enforcement** — hard-skip rule for mismatched `company:` field (skip silently, no cross-contamination), new hygiene check #6 for untagged company-specific memories, MEMORY.md index now supports `[company]` prefix for visual scanning
- **Company context persistence** — active company context now survives context compression: saved in milestone summaries, restored from todo list, explicit re-confirmation after compression events
- **`/validate-isolation` diagnostic skill** — scans L2 rules for missing scope headers, memory files for missing `company:` fields, cross-company directive conflicts, and MEMORY.md index format issues; outputs structured report with ✅/🟡/🔴 severity
- **Cross-reference in multi-company-isolation.md** — `/validate-isolation` now documented as the recommended diagnostic tool

## [1.7.0] - 2026-03-30

- **Memory company isolation** — memories now support `company:` frontmatter field to prevent cross-company rule bleed
- **`/init` scaffolds L2 rules** — new companies automatically get `.claude/rules/{company}/` with scoped copies of rule templates
- **`/use-company` skill** — explicitly set active company context for a conversation, complementing `/which-company` diagnostics
- **`/init` repo path flexibility** — no longer assumes `~/work/` as base dir; uses actual workspace root path
- **README bilingual integration** — Quick Start examples now show English/中文 side-by-side instead of separate blocks
- **CJK branch naming guard** — empty or invalid translations from CJK titles fall back to ticket key only (`task/PROJ-123`)
- **SA/SD Chinese alias update** — added 「寫 SA」「出 SA/SD」triggers, deprioritized misleading 「實作評估」
- **Stale backlog cleanup** — `review-pr` hardcoded paths already resolved in earlier genericization; item closed

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-30

- **Excluded `polaris-backlog.md` from template** — framework backlog is maintainer-only, no longer confuses new users
- **Added "What not to touch" guide** in README — clarifies which files are framework internals vs. safe to customize
- **Added "Upgrading" section** in README — documents `sync-from-polaris.sh` for pulling framework updates
- **Moved Zhang Liang inspiration** to "About the name" section — frees hero section for practical info
- **Added Claude Code plan/tier note** — specifies that sub-agent features need Max plan or API access
- **Added clone path guidance** — warns against `~/work` default to avoid conflicts
- **Pre-push hook first-time bypass** — first push skips the quality gate with an informational message instead of blocking
- **CHANGELOG rewritten** — user-facing release notes style, concise per-version summaries
- **Sync script fixed** — L2 rules now sync from `_template/rule-examples/` (v1.5.0+ path)
- **Removed obsolete skills** (`auto-improve`, `check-pr-approvals`, `dev-guide`)
- **Removed `ONBOARDING.md`** — was already absorbed into README in v1.1.0
