# Changelog

All notable changes to Polaris are documented here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

> Versions before 1.4.0 were retroactively tagged during the initial development sprint.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-30

- **Excluded `polaris-backlog.md` from template** — framework backlog is maintainer-only, no longer confuses new users
- **Added "What not to touch" guide** in README — clarifies which files are framework internals vs. safe to customize
- **Added "Upgrading" section** in README — documents `sync-from-polaris.sh` for pulling framework updates
- **Moved Zhang Liang inspiration** to "About the name" section — frees hero section for practical info
- **Added Claude Code plan/tier note** — specifies that sub-agent features need Max plan or API access
- **Added clone path guidance** — warns against `~/work` default to avoid conflicts
- **Pre-push hook first-time bypass** — first push skips the quality gate with an informational message instead of blocking
- **CHANGELOG rewritten** — user-facing release notes style, concise per-version summaries
- **Sync script fixed** — L2 rules now sync from `_template/rule-examples/` (v1.5.0+ path)
- **Removed obsolete skills** (`auto-improve`, `check-pr-approvals`, `dev-guide`)
- **Removed `ONBOARDING.md`** — was already absorbed into README in v1.1.0
